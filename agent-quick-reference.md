## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### When Agent Doesn't Understand

**Instead of:** "Handle my stuff"
**Try:** "Show me today's tasks and urgent emails"

**Instead of:** "Email thing"
**Try:** "Search emails from Sarah about the proposal"

**Instead of:** "Fix it"
**Try:** "Reschedule overdue tasks to next week"

### Getting Better Results

✅ **Be specific:** Include names, dates, topics
✅ **Use natural language:** "tomorrow", "next Monday"
✅ **Confirm important actions:** Review before sending emails
✅ **Provide context:** Reference previous conversations

## ⚙️ Customization

### Set Preferences
```
"Always flag emails from [person] as urgent"
"I prefer to review emails at 9 AM and 3 PM"
"Use P1 priority for client tasks"
"Group similar tasks together"
```

### Training the Agent
```
"That task should have been P2, not P1"
"When I say 'process inbox' include drafting replies"
"Use more concise summaries"
"Always ask before archiving emails"
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

**Privacy:**
- Agent never shares API keys
- Confirms before sending emails
- Asks permission for bulk operations (>10 items)

**Limitations:**
- Can't access emails older than Gmail API allows
- Todoist API rate limits may apply
- Works best with specific, clear requests

**Best Practices:**
- Review generated tasks before creating
- Confirm email drafts before sending
- Provide feedback to improve accuracy
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
